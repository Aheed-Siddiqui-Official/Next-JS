http://localhost:3000 => root page.js file

we cant name file service in service folder its necessary to name page.js or page.jsx
index.js will also not return

nested routes follow same rule page.jsx inside folder e.g. about/teams/page.jsx
nested layout follow same rule layout.jsx inside folder e.g. about/layout.jsx

a tag => Link component avoid refresh and gives hot reloading
import './globals.css'; in layout.js otherwise css will not apply

Global css v/s css modules

import "../globals.css";
if we enter a background eg in global css it will change the entire body
link in next/react => a tag in html
className in next/react/tailwind => class in html/css

import style from "./service.module.css"
service.module.css
same class names but different functionalities => css modules
className={style.common_heading} => class="service-module__dovOla__common_heading"  in html inspect
global and module both have same class so tranformed it deliberately so no conflict
