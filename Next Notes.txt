Lecture : 1
react framework made by vercel

file based routing no need to use browser router
server side rendering
seo
you can write api code of backend routes single server 
full stack power
dedicated image tag to avoid lazy loading
seo and lead generation
fast loading
static, dynamic website

used by Netflix, claude, vercel etc

Lecture : 2
npx create-next-app@latest

next dev : starts development server
next build : builds app for production
next start : starts the production server
next lint : Runs ESLint

layout js is main file

Lecture : 3
nextjs_app file name
.next => generates when first time app build or run
(page router before version 13) app folder/router 
=> page.js is home page
=> layout.js is root layout

node modules are those packages are used to run the project

public folder static assets
.gitignore
package.json > your project is dependent on which packages

layout.js is used to wrap pages and component with a hared structure such as headers, footers, or navigation bars. Consistent layout

about/
	page.js		//About page
	layout.js	//Layout page

contact/
	page.js		//Contact page


ctrl u => line wrap => body tag
children prop in layout means on the route of current file you are that children will be injected like /about page

Lecture : 4
Objectives => Routes, Nested Routes, Nested Layout

http://localhost:3000 => root page.js file

we cant name file service in service folder its necessary to name page.js or page.jsx
index.js will also not return

nested routes follow same rule page.jsx inside folder e.g. about/teams/page.jsx
nested layout follow same rule layout.jsx inside folder e.g. about/layout.jsx

Lecture : 5
a tag => Link component avoid refresh and gives hot reloading
import './globals.css'; in layout.js otherwise css will not apply
make different folder for routes outside the app folder and import in layout.js in app folder

Lecture : 6 
route group => way to organize your routes without effecting the urls e.g. user(http://localhost:3000/about), admin(http://localhost:3000/about) etc
dont want to show user type just about page
users => (users) route group that doesnt polute url
(users) => actual app folder
route group doesnt show on url

Lecture : 7
how to show navigation all pages except about
move about folder in root app folder 

Lecture : 8
how to install tailwind css in next.js application
ls, mkdir, rmdir

lecture : 9
Global css v/s css modules

import "../globals.css";
if we enter a background eg in global css it will change the entire body
link in next/react => a tag in html
className in next/react/tailwind => class in html/css

import style from "./service.module.css"
service.module.css
same class names but different functionalities => css modules
className={style.common_heading} => class="service-module__dovOla__common_heading"  in html inspect
global and module both have same class so tranformed it deliberately so no conflict

Lecture : 10
image component in next.js
when use any img in next.js must use width and height
auto optimize file size
convert img to webp

lazy loading and decoding. Both help make pages faster, reduce bandwidth usage, and improve Core Web Vitals (like LCP, CLS, and FID/INP).

1. Lazy Loading in Next.js <Image>
Lazy loading means the browser delays fetching and processing the image until it's needed — typically when the image is close to (or inside) the user's viewport (the visible part of the page).
How it works in Next.js:

By default: loading="lazy" (automatic since Next.js 11+)
The browser only starts downloading the image file when it calculates that the image will soon appear on screen (usually ~50–100px before it enters the viewport).

Decoding controls when and how the browser processes (decodes) the downloaded image bytes into pixels that can be painted on screen.
Images (JPEG, WebP, AVIF, PNG…) arrive compressed → browser must decode them before showing.

Why async is usually best (and default):

Prevents main-thread blocking → smoother scrolling and interaction
Avoids jank (stutter) when many images are loading
Modern browsers decode images off the main thread anyway, so async aligns with that

fill={true} => no width and height
if using fill property and want to show full img on parent component then parent comp should be relative
quality = {75} by default can do 100 too
priority = {false} loading website need on spot or lazy loading on that section
placeholder = {blur} => internet slow can show blur img
must include blurDataUrl => if using placeholder blur
if want to show blur part must import image from source

Lecture : 11
Next.js fonts

font module of next itself => fast optimization
no request again and again to google fonts server

import {Roboto} from "next/font/google"
subset target audience language seo no extra fonts loading

const roboto = Roboto({
  subsets:["latin"],
  weight:"400"
})

html tag => lang="en"

Lecture : 12
How to Add Multiple fonts in Next

const workSans = Work_Sans({
  subsets: ["latin"],
  variable: "--font-work-sans",
});

<body className={`${roboto.variable} ${workSans.variable}`}>

body { 
 --font-work: var(--font-work-sans);
}

<h1 className="text-3xl text-red-500 underline font-roboto">Welcome, MAS</h1>

Lecture : 13
meta data seo mastery

when search your website a heading and paragraph appears => meta tag
head tag doesn't matter in next.js
meta viewport tag doesn't makes your website responsive
meta data object
if seo matters alot in your website use next.js

export const metadata = {
  title: "Service Page",
  description: "This is my service page",
  authors: [{ name: "MAS" }, { name: "AAS" }],
  keywords:['nextjs', "reactjs", "fullstack"]
};

root layout.js meta-data

og tags help to share url in card format
metadatabase gets your url

Lecture : 14 
React Server vs Client Component in Next.js

next.js is a fullstack framework you can write frontend backend code both
the things you want to do in react you can do in next.js by making client component
server related code is done in server component file => secret api keys, data get display
fcp => first contentful pain if opening a page but it gets by default loaded you get in server component

not formal definations
react frontend code in client comp
express backend code in server component

thats why called fullstack framework

app folder files are by default react server component except error.js
to use states and fire button click events we have to convert app files to client component

in client component when making jsx function never make it async

by default the file is react server component => we make it client component

"use client" => makes client component

in server component network tab we cant see the urls ana apikeys without exposing to client
but in client component we can see it leaks urls and api keys or .env files

if you make a page/file client component and use other server components in that file without "use client" they automatically becomes client components

parent use client component can make their inherit server child component to client component

secure data dont want to expose server comp
next fetch all data at server => dump on load
react functions/event listeners cant use in server component
frontend react => use client
backend express => server comp

Lecture : 15
Dynamic route segments
dynamic data in routes
by wrapping a folder name in [] brackets

[username] is a dynamic route segment

nested dynamic route segment 
users/[username]/page.jsx
username/[posts]/page.jsx

dynamic route segments can only be made in server components

Lecture : 16
Dynamic route segments in client components
if we write 'use client' in client component : <SingleProfilePost> is an async Client Component. Only Server Components can be async at the moment. This error is often caused by accidentally adding `'use client'` to a module that was originally written for the server.

if you want to use dynamic routes in client component the put promise data in => use() hook

write 'use client' => remove async wait => use 'use()' in promise data

Lecture : 17
How to Use URL Query Strings in Next.js
SearchParams : useful for building features like filtering, sorting, and pagination(how many products to show based on page) - all which are essential in ecommerce

after question mark data in the url is called query string

http://localhost:3000/products?category=shoes

http://localhost:3000/products?category=shoes&page=2 => show second page laptop data

http://localhost:3000/products?category=shoes&page=2&sort=price-asc => price in ascending order

const Products = async ({ searchParams }) => {
  const searchParam = await searchParams;
//   console.log(searchParam);

  const category = searchParam?.category || "all";
  const sort = searchParam?.sort || "default";
  const page = searchParam?.page || 1;
  console.log(searchParam);
  

  return (
    <div>
      Showing {category} products, sorted by {sort}, page {page}
    </div>
  );
};

export default Products;
